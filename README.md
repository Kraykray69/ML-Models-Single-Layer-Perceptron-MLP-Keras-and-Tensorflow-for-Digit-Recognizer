#ML Models, Single-Layer Perceptron, MLP, Keras and TensorFlow for Digit Recognizer

This project involves building and training machine learning models to recognize handwritten digits using the popular MNIST dataset. The models include a simple Single-Layer Perceptron (SLP) and a more complex Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP). The Single-Layer Perceptron is the simplest form of a neural network, consisting of a single layer of weights directly connecting input features to output predictions. The Multi-Layer Perceptron, on the other hand, includes one or more hidden layers, enabling the model to capture more complex patterns and achieve higher accuracy. The project leverages the Keras API with TensorFlow as the backend to implement and train these models efficiently. Through this project, you will understand the fundamentals of neural networks, the benefits of deeper architectures, and practical skills in using Keras and TensorFlow for building and deploying digit recognition systems.
